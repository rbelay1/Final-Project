I realized right away that it looked just like the SciLi.” Reportedly, the SciLi duplicate had 15 identical floors, 3 elevators, and even a cafe in the lobby. “The only difference between the two,” said Chu, “is that the one in Dubai is bright yellow.”\n",
            "“At the start I thought people were joking,” said Freshman Max Harris, voicing the opinion of many Brown students who questioned the Dubai’s SciLi existence at first, “But over break one of my friends connected through Dubai and posted a photo on their Snapstory. I still don’t understand why anyone would want another SciLi in the first place. It definitely looks weird painted yellow, though.”\n",
            "According to firsthand accounts from Dubai International Airport, the SciLi twin is difficult to miss. Located between a Duty Free store and a massage kiosk, many patrons look twice at the hulking library. Some have even gone out of their way to catch a glimpse of the library duplicate, making the trek to Terminal 4 just to tell their friends back home what they saw.\n",
            "At Brown, some students seemed disappointed at the presence of another SciLi. “It definitely makes ours feel less special,” said Harris. “But if I’m in Dubai, I guarantee you I’ll go and check it out.”\n"

            "“Not only is pesto safe for consumption,” said lead scientist Karen Drake, “It can be very yummy on pasta. Research showed that the pesto does not even need to be home-made; throwing a dollop of store-bought pesto will do the trick.”\n",
            "“We’ve done a series of randomized-control trials and across the board we saw that plain old pasta just doesn’t hold a candle to pasta with a little bit of pesto mixed through it,” continued Drake, referencing a chart that showed that, yeah, just about everyone can enjoy a bowl of pesto pasta. “It doesn’t have to be a lot of pesto. Just a spoonful or two. You want it to get that green color but not be too overpowering.”\n",
            "The report stated that even if you think pesto is not your thing because you tried it on other food, like crackers or pizza or something, you need to give it a try on pasta.\n",
            "“It’s so easy,\" said Drake. \"All you have to do is throw a tiny scoop in there and mix it up.”\n",
            "The study went on to conclude that you should definitely throw a little cheese on top of that pesto pasta but warned that some pestos might already contain cheese and you don’t want to go overboard with the cheese.\n",

            "In fact, Nicco has gained a reputation throughout campus of being unbreakable. “He really plays by his own rules and isn’t afraid to do something different from everyone else,” elaborated Huang. “I respect that maverick spirit.”\n",
            "According to other students, Nicco’s chattering teeth and shallow breathing after he eats lunch on the steps of Faunce in below-freezing weather are not symptoms of hypothermia, but instead are signs of his robust masculinity. “Sure, he occasionally gets mild frostbite on his calves,” added Huang. “But Al is the beacon of rugged individualism that our millennial generation is missing.”\n"

            "NPR’s “Morning Edition” skipped the news today in favor of a uninterrupted hour of jazzy clarinet interludes, listeners report. Although the popular radio program touts itself as a leader in world news, this morning it delivered obscure jazz in lieu of hard-hitting stories right up until “Morning Concert” took the air at 9:00.\n",
            "“I love the little snippets of music they throw in between segments,” said listener Molly Koehler, “and this morning it took me a while to realize they actually weren’t gonna do the news, just a bunch of 4-second clarinet solos they appear to have found on the Jazz & Blues page of Soundcloud.”\n",
            "Although Koehler found the format unconventional, she was unfazed by the journalistic choice. “I can’t say I’m surprised. Those interludes are the highlight of the hour, so why beat around the bush?”\n",
            "At press time, producers were queuing up an hour of classical guitar riffs for this afternoon’s edition of “Fresh Air.”\n"
