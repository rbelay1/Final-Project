            "Helpless bystanders reported Thursday that Glock Brandish, a superhero whose power is using a gun, is really upstaging the rest of his superteam.\n",
            "“The Necronomic Order has been terrorizing New Metropolis for months now, and the Anointed Gauntlet superteam keeps coming to our city’s defense,” commented citizen and terrified bystander Philip Spacek as he glanced nervously between surrounding skyscrapers. “But Glock Brandish has really been doing the lion’s share of the saving. There’s usually not even a chance for villains to give nasty monologues or set up elaborate hostage situations because Glock just pulls out his gun and kills them.”\n",
            "“It’s really nice to have the Anointed Gauntlet protecting our city, but I kinda wish I could see the rest of the team in action,” Spacek continued. “There’s a woman who floats around in a glowing purple orb, and I don’t even know what her name is or what she does. But whatever it is, it’s probably a little more exciting than Glock demonstrating his marksmanship skills on Necronomic Order peons.”\n",
            "“If we have to be constantly terrorized by the forces of evil, I at least want to find out what the rest of the Anointed Gauntlet can do,” Spacek explained, kicking at empty bullet casings on the pavement. “I’m sure the guy with six arms who’s made of red goop and the half-bear, half-gorilla person would love to get in on the action, rather than just watching Glock Brandish spend less than a minute shooting villains every time.”\n",
            "At press time, Glock Brandish fled the city to confront his nemesis Target Man after seeing a glowing gun projected in the sky.\n"

            "“It’s pretty insane when you think about it,” the release said, highlighting the fact that your achievements are apparently not as impressive as those of multiple puppets. “You’ve spent years trying to be successful. Big Bird is honored forever with a star on the Walk of Fame, and he doesn’t even know it, because he’s a 16-pound body puppet made of feathers and high-quality felt.”\n",
            "“You pour so much time, effort, and money into achieving your dreams,” the statement continued, relentlessly hammering in the fact that Kermit the Frog received a ceremony marking his induction into the Walk of Fame that was televised and attended by actor David Arquette, while you are toiling away at career goals that will never come to fruition. “Kermit is a fictional personality assigned to a puppet, and Hollywood will honor him forever. How does it feel?”\n",
            "“If none of this made you feel like a failure, remember that all of The Muppets were presented with a star back in 2010, implying that the achievements of literally hundreds of whimsical puppets outshine everything you have ever worked for in your life.”\n",

            "Gil Caribou, an actor in a Providence-based Shakespeare company, is excited to make the material feel modern by air-humping at all the sex lines.\n",
            "“I’m really looking forward to making some bold choices this season,” said Caribou of his choice do some gross body movements whenever a character refers to sex. “Not everyone knows that when Othello’s Iago says ‘The beast with two backs,’ he is referring to sex. I’m going to make these racy words feel electric by thrusting into the air while repeatedly cocking my eyebrows.”\n",
            "Caribou also plans to do a smarmy little tiger roar at the end of the line, even though his director specifically told him not to.\n",
            "“Later in the season, as Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing, I get to say the line ‘I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes,’\" Caribou said of the line, which he will make wholly uncomfortable for everyone. “Not many people know that at the time, ‘die’ was Elizabethan slang for orgasm, but I’m going to make the audience know. That’s why when I say the line, I’m going to let out a show-stopping sex moan. And I’ll do it while air-humping of course!”\n",
            "At press time, Caribou put on a jingly clown hat to let the audience know his character is supposed to be funny.\n"
