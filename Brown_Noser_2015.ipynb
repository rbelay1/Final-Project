            "Samuels has reportedly tried everything. “My three idiosyncratic roommates like to watch sports, but I can’t ever watch with them because I have to play in all the games,” said Samuels, who is a quarterback for the Cleveland Browns and the starting point guard for the Kings, Lakers and Clippers. “And it doesn’t help that so many of the news stories are about me.”\n",

Despite his heavy workload, Samuels still finds time to watch some television at the end of the day. He just wishes there was more variety.\n",

            "According to the account of grief-stricken residents, the town of Dalton, Ga. gathered together as a community on Sunday to vaguely remember Rachel Milliner, the teenage victim of last week’s hit-and-run car accident.\n",
            "“Rachel never, so far as I can recall, had a mean word to say to anybody,” recounted classmate Alex Johnston, who sat behind Rachel last year in Algebra—unless it was the Rachel that sat in front of him the year before in Geometry. “She will be missed. I think.”\n",
            "Friends and community members expressed feelings of sorrow at the loss of young life, heartache in the fact of this senseless killing, and frustration at not quite being able to remember what Rachel looked like. Some figured that Rachel was the girl who was always talking about horses. Others contended that Rachel was the girl whose family owned a speedboat. All, however, reported only being able to remember Rachel and her life as a sort of blur, as if seen in soft-focus or underwater.\n",
            "“The candlelight service was very tasteful,” Johnston said. “From what I can remember about her, I guess Rachel would have liked that.”\n",
            "The memorial featured a series of eulogies from familiar-enough town figures presumably close to the deceased, a series of family videos from her early childhood, and a picture slideshow set to Rachel’s favorite songs—all of which helped to place Rachel loosely within the social reality of the town, though not bring her to clear and distinct recall.\n",
            "“Rachel may be gone, but her memory lives on, however hazy and malformed,\" said Ashton Barkley, principal of the high school that Rachel attended, at least according to some people who had a vague memory of Rachel going there.\n",
            "A monument will be erected at the site of Milliner’s death in the next months, featuring a local sculptor’s rendering of that girl with the red hair who everyone is pretty sure might have been Rachel Milliner.\n"

            "New analysis from archivists at the University of Virginia suggest that Hitler’s bodyguards must have been very skilled in their dispatching of assassins sent from the future to kill the then Chancellor of Germany.\n",
            "“Hitler lived long enough to kill himself,” reported lead researcher Jennifer Richardson. “That means none of the many assassins that surely came from the future to kill him were able to finish their job. That’s a good security team.”\n",
            "Richardson’s report went on to argue that considering the time traveling assassins probably had highly-powered future weapons, Hitler’s bodyguards would have to have prepared for attacks they couldn’t possibly expect.\n",
            "“They probably watched the air for signs of temporal disturbance, checked for disturbances in Earth’s magnetic field, and checked the chronometers they must’ve invented and then destroyed before anyone else could have found out about them,” continued Richardson, adding that those were all things that might help detect time travelers. “Then the bodyguards probably shot them.”\n",
            "The report also puts forth the possibility that when Hitler was 17, his art institute application was replaced with a superior portfolio, then switched back and forth an indeterminate number of times by other time travelers.\n",
            "Additional documentation suggests that John Wilkes Booth must have fought off nearly a dozen time-traveling counter-assassins before entering Ford’s Theatre.\n"

Phew!”\n",

            "In a statement released Thursday, the Central Intelligence Agency unequivocally denounced all use of torture on suspected terrorists unless the suspects might know something important.\n",
            "“The United States has a complicated history of enhanced interrogation, we will not deny,” wrote C.I.A. Director John O. Brennan in the release. “But let us be slightly clearer: the days of torturing suspects are over, if the suspects definitely don’t know anything we want to know.”\n",
            "The statement marks a new era in U.S. enhanced interrogation strategy, with the C.I.A. exempting all alleged terrorists from torture except for those who could have information that might prove useful to national interests. “If we have no need for any kind of intelligence, those in custody can and will enjoy all the benefits of the same torture-free lifestyle as is protected in almost every other developed nation,” Brennan continued.\n",
            "Sources confirm that human rights activists around the country are cautiously optimistic about this development. “Torture is off the table, unless the C.I.A. wants to know something that the suspect could know,” says Amnesty International attorney Camilla Rodriguez. “Even extraordinary rendition has been condemned in situations where nothing is at stake. This is progress, plain and simple, I think.”\n",
            "Many of these changes come after the Senate Intelligence Committee released a 6,000-page report detailing U.S. torture tactics between 2001 and 2006. As a response, the C.I.A.’s new stance declares that all U.S. personnel found to be using torture to extract information will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, unless the information that the suspect might have includes names, locations, relationships, travel history, or recent purchases of people that the C.I.A. wants to learn about.\n",
            "At press time, the C.I.A. had released a second statement conceding, “Torture is sometimes okay, but definitely not when it’s used by bad guys on good guys.”\n"
