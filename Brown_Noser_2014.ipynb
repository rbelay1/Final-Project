Some figured that Rachel was the girl who was always talking about horses. Others contended that Rachel was the girl whose family owned a speedboat. All, however, reported only being able to remember Rachel and her life as a sort of blur, as if seen in soft-focus or underwater.\n",

            "The memorial featured a series of eulogies from familiar-enough town figures presumably close to the deceased, a series of family videos from her early childhood, and a picture slideshow set to Rachel’s favorite songs—all of which helped to place Rachel loosely within the social reality of the town, though not bring her to clear and distinct recall.\n",

            "In the wake of Russia’s illegal incursion into Crimea, the cops moved swiftly to bring to justice all involved. President Putin, Parliamentary leaders, and the entire higher command of the Russian Army were peacefully subdued and brought directly to prison.\n",
            "“Invading Ukraine is a clear violation of the law,” said Sheriff Patty O’Brian. “We had no choice but to place everyone involved under arrest.”\n",
            "Added O’Brian, “Everyone here is going to jail.”\n",
            "International observers applauded the arrest. “Thank goodness we were able to quickly resolve this whole situation without bloodshed,” said United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. “I can’t imagine what would have happened if the cops hadn’t shown up.”\n",
            "Said relieved Ukrainian Prime Minster Arseniy Yatsenyuk, “This is exactly why we have cops.”\n",
            "The incident immediately called to mind the 2003 arrest of President Bush for the unauthorized invasion of Iraq, along with arrest of Bashar al-Assad for attacking his own citizens and the capture of President Obama for his blatantly illegal drone program. Al-Assad and the entire cabinets of both presidents are currently serving 12-year terms in a maximum security prison, thus deterring anyone else from violating international law ever again.\n",
            "“Today, we have sent a clear message to the world’s leaders,” said Police Chief Jimmy Callahan. “You cannot simply invade countries and put civilian lives at risk whenever you want. It’s illegal.”\n",

            "Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced on Friday that the United States Department of Defense would be switching its national security strategy to man-to-man coverage. “Upon weighing the comparative merits of a conventional policy combining military and contractor resources versus one based on a stripped down, man-to-man approach,\" Hagel explained, \"the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I decided it would be best to change up our playbook.”\n",
            "“Each ‘X’ stands for one of our personnel. Each ‘O’ is a real or potential danger to our domestic and foreign interests,” Hagel said, pointing to a world-map chalkboard.\n",
            "The Defense Secretary explained that, rather than dealing with terrorist organizations and other hostile forces through first detection by the U.S. intelligence network and then elimination of high-value targets, the department will now be deploying a single federal agent to guard each enemy belligerent.\n",
            "“This is a more aggressive game plan than our previous tactics. Our soldiers, strategists, and intelligence analysts are now going to be expected to stay on an assigned threat, box out that threat, and—where necessary—eliminate said threat.”\n",
            "Responding to criticism that such coverage might leave the U.S. more open to certain offensive maneuvers, Hagel assured press that no comprehensive defense policy is perfect and that, of course, his first priority is keeping Americans safe. He also went on to dismiss proponents of a strategy geared more towards focus on maintaining regional, zone-oriented stabilities as part of international cooperative efforts.\n",
            "“I say now with total confidence that a man-to-man allocation of funds and staffers is the best possible solution going forward,\" Hagel said. \"We’ve got to catch America’s enemies off-balance. We’ve got to get in their faces. We’ve got to rattle their cages a little bit.”\n",
            "Hagel closed with a demonstration of the defensive stance all agents are now to be trained in: feet planted wide, eyes up, with shoulders over the knees so that they will be harder to knock down.\n"

            "Clad in a bathing suit, flippies and a tank top reading, “Keep Calm and Pool Party: Birthday Bash at the Mayor’s House,” Mayor Tad Buckles vowed at a press conference yesterday to get to the bottom of just who approved blowing the entire pension fund on snacks, brews and an impromptu performance by the mayor’s best friend’s band. “We will not rest until we discover who thought handing out free cash to all the babes who showed was a good use of taxpayer dollars,” said Buckles, hurriedly tipping a pool boy and several magicians from out of town. “I’d like to apologize to our city’s workers who will likely be forced to delay their retirement by years, especially the ones who didn’t get an invite to this sick unrelated pool party last week.” As of press time, Buckles and his entire senior staff were embarking on a fact-finding mission to the district attorney’s beach house in Key West.\n",
