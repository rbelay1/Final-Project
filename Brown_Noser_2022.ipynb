            "After laying the philosophical groundwork for the next two millennia, ancient philosopher Byonacles was about to end his hot streak by saying that dogs are what happens when horses are born at night.\n",
            "“They have four legs just like a horse but they look so mean with their sharp teeth and mean is dark like the night,” muttered Byonacles to himself, pacing around a humid cellar where in only a few short moments he will conceive an absolute dud of a theory. “So, ipso facto, the scary dog is just the nice horse birthed in the mean night!”\n",
            "“And that hair! Those dogs and their thick coats! You’d only need fur that thick in the coldest of conditions, like perhaps… NIGHT TIME!” exclaimed Byonacles to himself, really missing the mark with his new idea and yet still somehow becoming the most respected philosopher in all of Athens. “If a dog is truly just a night horse, it follows that after being chained in the city square for 20 days and 20 nights a strong and fertile mare covered in thick tapestries and shielded from sunlight should birth a dog both mean and hairy! Undeniable proof!”\n",

            "Residents of Spruce Street in Barrington report that they are constantly being woken by an annoying-ass bird which wants nothing but to herald fine mornings with its jubilant song. “Can that thing just shut up?” said Evan Prendor, as the sparrow outside his window sang in clear, sweet tones of the coming of a fresh day upon this verdant earth. “What the hell is its problem? It needs to chill the fuck out.” At press time, Prendor found the delicate little nest the bird had made on the bough of an oak tree and knocked it down with a rake.\n",
