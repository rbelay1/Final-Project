We’re emphatic supporters of student activism, unless it’s the kind that goes against any of those things.”\n",

I’m having the toughest time deciding between these three internship opportunities for this summer and I feel like you would be able to help me out. The first one’s in New York and they cover housing and food and also it’s super prestigious but it’s in New York and New York is so big and I’ve never been there! The second one is in my hometown, which is great because then I won’t have to pay for housing—and they are giving me a 10k stipend.\n"

With a body like that, a parade is the least we could do. You don’t see height like that every day.” Daboole punctuated the celebration by handing him the keys to the village. “I wish I could give him my kidneys,” said Daboole. “He’s a goddamn hero. If it were up to me, I’d trade my mother for him. He could have every cent I earn for the next 20 years. I love him. Y’know, come to think of it, I never got his name.” At press time, the tall man was elected as the new mayor.\n",

            "“I thought by using my air fryer to cook meals for my family, I could reduce my time spent in the kitchen,” Latham explained, desperately trying to force four servings worth of chicken into the air fryer’s flimsy, six-inch plastic basket. “Instead, I’ve spent countless hours tinkering with the air fryer to try to get it to prepare a meal that would, in retrospect, be much easier to cook in a conventional oven.”\n",
            "“It’s my great-grandma’s recipe, and it’s been passed down through my family for generations,” Latham added, not acknowledging that coq au vin requires a culinary acumen that cannot be delegated to a simple kitchen appliance like an air fryer. “But for some reason I struggled to get the air fryer tray to slide back in with the five-pound raw chicken carcass in it.\"\n",
            "“I’ve used my air fryer to make tater tots and Brussels sprouts, so I figured I could start using it to make more gourmet meals,” Latham continued, as the air fryer began beeping violently and smoking. “But I guess coq au vin is an entirely different kind of recipe, with a variety of ingredients and a constant attendance to things like temperature and moisture.”\n",
            "At press time, Latham’s toaster oven was unsurprisingly incapable of baking an entire loaf of ciabatta.\n"
