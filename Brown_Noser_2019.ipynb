            "“There’s this Granoff Dinner thing so I figured it’d be nice to do something similar for students who aren’t in the top 1%,” Gilbert said. “I got cheese because I figured everyone would like it. Everyone should be able to get at least one slice, but we’ll have to see if there’s enough for seconds. I’m also bringing a bag of tortilla chips and a can of salsa, though, so it should be fine.”\n",
            "“I also got some two-liter bottles of Sprite and Diet Coke and one of those plastic boxes of sugar cookies from the grocery store,” Gilbert reported as she furnished the tables with white, plastic tablecloths and loose handfuls of Tootsie Rolls. “I just want everyone to be happy.”\n",

            "“We tried to improve the speed of the horses by adding motors, sneakers, and even extra legs,” Beckham continued, presenting the results of failed experiments. “In the end, nothing made the horses speedier than a good old-fashioned set of wheels.”\n",
            "“In the 21st century, horses are normally perceived as a slow and outdated mode of transportation,” added Beckham, showing reporters video footage of scientists riding their horses on the highway. “But with wheels, the horse becomes a quick and convenient mode of transportation for errands, long trips, or even street racing.”\n",

It’s hard to believe since he is so wrinkly now, but in the old movie he is fresh-faced and handsome. In one he plays a wise professor, and the other a star quarterback, but the evidence doesn’t lie—this is the same man.” At press time, experts reported that the young dog in the old movie is now dead.\n",
